Description: The 'pumBayes' package provides a set of tools for Bayesian 
    estimation and analysis of Probit Unfolding Models (PUMs), specifically 
    designed for binary preference data. PUMs are a novel class of scaling 
    models that allow for both monotonic and non-monotonic response functions. 
    The package supports Bayesian inference for both static and dynamic PUMs 
    using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that require minimal or 
    no tuning. Key functionalities include posterior sampling, hyperparameter 
    selection, data preprocessing, model fit evaluation, and visualization. 
    The package is particularly useful for analyzing voting data, such as 
    those from the U.S. Congress or Supreme Court, but can also be applied 
    to other contexts where non-monotonic response functions are expected.
